## Solutions to LeetCode problems for my own record
I've been solving LeetCode problems for a while as a hobby, but then I found myself in a habit of not documenting the code
and not thinking of test cases. This repository's aim is to fix these issues in my code.

To run any piece of the LeetCode problem, run
```
python3 <file_name>
```
